**AWS Resource Automation Script**

**DESCRIPTION**
This script automates the creation of essential AWS resources, such as an S3 bucket, Lambda function, IAM roles, and SNS topics, all orchestrated to work together. Below, you'll find the steps for using this script effectively:

**Requirements:**

1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI and jq installed.
        
2. Replace the placeholder values in the script with your specific AWS configuration.

**Script Explanation:**

🩹 The script begins by creating an IAM role with the necessary permissions.

🩹 It checks if the role already exists and attaches AWS policies accordingly.

🩹 Creates an S3 bucket and uploads a sample file to it.

🩹 Compresses the Lambda function code into a ZIP file.

🩹 Creates a Lambda function using the compressed code.

🩹 Configures permissions for S3 to invoke the Lambda function.

🩹 Sets up an S3 event trigger for the Lambda function.

🩹 Creates an SNS topic and generates an IAM policy for it.

🩹 Attaches the IAM policy to the specified IAM user.


**Usage:**

 1. Save the script to a file, e.g., setup-aws-resources.sh.

 2. Make the script executable: 
 
        chmod +x setup-aws-resources.sh.
        
 3. Run the script:

          ./setup-aws-resources.sh.
